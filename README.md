# I Craft in Peace

This is a mod that makes playing in peaceful mode (because you wimp out like me) possible. The only purpose is to add
crafting recipes and items purely to unlock other items.

Some items are harder to craft than others. This is intentional. Some of the potentially more controversial choices I
will go through here (if I get enough complaints I will think about rebalancing the item):

### Blank Record

It takes 8 obsidian and an end crystal to craft this. This might sound difficult, but to reliably get a disc, you have
to have a skeleton or a stray shoot a creeper. Even then, you might not get the disc you want. Because of these
difficulties, the music disc is expensive.
