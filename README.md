# I Craft in Peace
![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag-date/parmort/mc-icraftinpeace?color=forestgreen&label=version&style=for-the-badge)

This is a mod that makes playing in peaceful mode (because you wimp out like me) possible. The only purpose is to add
crafting recipes and items purely to unlock other items.
